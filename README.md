Study Buddy

-A study application written in ReactJS that would be marketed towards schools, institutions, and businesses that would allow for their students or employees or whomever to log in with an account and have access to syllabi, study guides, practice exams, research material, virtual libraries etc.. posted to the specific class/topic/business portal by instructors or facilitators. 

- The app would also allow for students to study together with classmates utilizing the Skype API. We also will have functionality for users to search for study content using the Digital Library of America API which provides users access to books, articles, videos and a plethora of data.

- A discussion board page will also be implemented allowing for users to create an open forum type dialog with peers regarding topics of study.

- Link to contact teachers, advisers, aides, or employers for help with questions or issues.

- Users will also be able to save articles, links, notes, or study materials to their account/profile for recurrent use by storing the information in a mongoDB and mongoose. The API's will be handled through an express server implementing GET and POST routes.
